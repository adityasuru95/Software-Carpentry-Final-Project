# Software-Carpentry-Final-Project


# Description
Repository for the final project for SOftware Carpentry. I have built an app (one complete, one incomplete) in Android Studio using Flutter. The language which I used was Dart.

# Contents
This repository contains the following directores
1. Dart Learning - 
2. Flutter Learning
3. Faraday v1
4. Beacon 4 stable

# Dart and FLutter
I wanted to make something which I personally could use. The best bet was an app / website. I decided to make an android app. 

I decided to break away from Python since I found the kivy and beeware packages of python for app development too cumbersome. I did some research and came to a conclusion that it is better to code the app in Dart using FLutter and Android Studio. FLutter is a package by google through which an app on all platforms can be deployed using a single codebase. Dart is a language very similar to Java. Since I did not have any background in either Java or Dart, I learnt Dart using the Freecodecamp. FLutter from youtube videos (Academind). I also bought a course by Angela Yu on Flutter (on 30 November)

# Faraday v1

## Motivation
While working in the medical campus, I came across a very pesky problem. I deal with mice and tumors. We have to periodically measure the height, width of the tumor (once ot twice a week). We also weight the tumor once harvested. Although the job is quite simple, 2 people are needed to perform it. One to measure and one to note down the data. Also, the tumors after harvesting are weighed on a weighing scale which gives its input in a printed statement. We have to transfer the data to excel later. DOing this for 20 mice, every week is a painful exercise.

I wanted to make an application which would simplify this process and would eliminiate the need for the 2nd person. An app, that would take the data using voice recognition in a table without much human intervention.

I have succeeded in one aspect by creating this app. The remaining task to do is: storing the app data to a database (I found this extremely complex for flutter, particularly because I don't have much exposure to the numerous classes and objects. even storing an int value to a file is a 10 lines code!)
